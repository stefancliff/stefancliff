- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stefancliff
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Games Design, Games Programming, Software and Data Engineering 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning at Singidunum in their SDE course.
- I have uploaded a few projects I worked on over the years during my studies at Singidunum, but I do have a decent amount I couldn't really format to fit the site really. I also have a few from my high school years.
