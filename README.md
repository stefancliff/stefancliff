- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stefancliff
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Games Design, Games Programming and Software Engineering 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning at Singidunum in their SDE course.


- I have uploaded a few projects I worked on over the years during my studies at Singidunum, as well as a few private ones. I hope in future to upload more of my work, showing off my journey and the various fields I've dipped my toes into.
