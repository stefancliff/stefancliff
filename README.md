  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stefancliff.<br>
  ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Games Design, Games Programming and Software Engineering.<br>
  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a fourth year student at Singidunum University, the course is SDE (Software and Data Engineering) which is all done in English.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
  I have uploaded a few projects I worked on over the years during my studies at Singidunum, as well as a few private ones. I hope in future to upload more of my work, showing off my journey and the various fields I've dipped my toes into.

  - My top languages are: Java, C++, C#, C
  - But I am comfortable with: TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Python 
  - Currently following some courses on Unity/Game Development and solo studies/practice in other fields.
  - Pronouns: He/Him
</p>
<br>
  Here is the ratio of languages I've used in my projects so far
